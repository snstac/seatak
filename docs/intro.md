## What does SeaTAK Do?

Any smartphone or computer running ATAK, WinTAK or iTAK, when paired to an SeaTAK gateway, 
displays aircraft data in native TAK formats.

For example, in this field configuration, a Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphone running ATAK was paired to an SeaTAK device carried in a backpack. The SeaTAK was powered by a portable USB battery 
also in the backpack. No outside internet connectivity (no LTE, no WiFi) was utilized by the smartphone or SeaTAK gateway

On a sunny & warm June day in downtown San Diego, a range of 55 miles was achived using this 
configuration.

SeaTAK creates a standalone ADS-B to TAK Gateway using WiFi. When paired with an ATAK, 
WinTAK or iTAK end-user device, SeaTAK displays real-time aircraft data in native TAK 
formats. This allows TAK users to gain airspace situational awareness in an easily 
portable, turn-key device. When connected to a local or wide area network, SeaTAK extends the operational coverage area and incrases airspace situational awareness.


## Where is SeaTAK used?

SeaTAK is in active use by wildland fire, security, safety & response organizations world-wide.
